# Stash

Stash is an iOS app that makes it possible to save contacts outside your contact list. These contacts are identifiable when they call you so you don't lose contact discovery.
Personally, this is useful to me because saving contacts to my contacts list automatically makes them available to platforms like WhatsApp. This means that those users can view my status updates if they have my contact saved as well. I love my privacy! If you're reading this, you probably love this level of privacy too.

## How to Use

Currently, Stash is not available on the AppStore. You can clone this project and build for your iPhone.
After you've cloned this project, run the `CallDirectoryExtension` scheme and choose `Stash` as the app to run on.
